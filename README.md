World of Warcraft api
This simple console line program will help Guild leaders better manage their guild without having to resort to third party addons and services. This is a work in progress. Please use guild: "is naked" on realm: "stormscale" to perform system tests. Thank you.

How to use: run the python file directly from folder or open in Windows PowerShell. Prompts will work with any guild in the US.
  TESTING PURPOSES: (my guild: Is Naked / Stormscale) (me: esosj)

UPDATE:
  - Added Guild rankings based on metrics provided by warlogs
  - Cleaned up menu ui
  - Added several new options which will be available next update
