Project name: Guild Management Tool
Programmers: Frieden Stone
Code Reviewer: Shayne Zamora

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of _5_ based on the following criteria:

1  The documentation is insufficient to enabled me to compile the project, or at least one of the program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:
	
4  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not produce the deliverables specified in the documentation for thei submission or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output, produces all of the specified deliverables, and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:

	     The code runs properly and works great! With this taken out, each unit runs and works properly. However, there is no information on whether this project is in Python 2.7 or Python 3.6. Other than this, the code is VERY well organized, everything looks great. However, comments and documentation is virtually non existent outside of the README.md file
 Try adding more comments within the code itself to help the user know what the function does and how it works. Maybe provide some introductory directions before the project begins in the code or in a seperate file. The directions are good, the menus are very clean and easy to read, the code looks AMAZING and CLEAN. Other than the raid.txt file not compiling properly eveything else works properly and looks great!
